# basic-11
Here's another simple BASIC code example that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

In this code:

- The program prompts the user to enter the number of Fibonacci terms they want to generate using the INPUT command.
- It initializes variables A and B to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- It then uses a FOR loop to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to the Nth term.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the next term C by adding A and B, updates the values of A and B accordingly, and prints the current term.
- The loop continues until it reaches the specified number of terms.
- Finally, it prints a newline character to separate the sequence from any subsequent output.

This code demonstrates how to use loops and variables to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence in BASIC.
